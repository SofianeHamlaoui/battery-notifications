# Battery notification sound 
After searching for some alarm sounds, on Github : ```alarm, :.oga``` I found that a lot of people use
`alarm-clock-elapsed.oga` located at `/usr/share/sounds/freedesktop/stereo/`

## Installation :

1. Install `acpi` package :

        sudo apt-get install acpi

2. Clone this repo :
        
        git clone https://github.com/hg8/battery-full-notification.git
        
3. Add the `batteryfull.sh` script as a startup application (Open Dash and search for `Startup Applications`) :

    ![startup application](http://i.imgur.com/pWcq9TW.png)

4. Done!
